# Backdoor on Python: Server - Client
___You need run a server and if you know target local ip, you can change connect_ip, path: target/game.py___

# HOW IT WORKS?
# - You connecting to a server and your target too connecting to your *SERVER IP*, after this you can send commands and target will be runs this command on PC
# - You can send commands like: dir ~(check what in directory), del ~(delete any files), calc.exe ~(runs calculator) and more ON TARGET PC...
# - Also you can clone and run your programm on a target computer
# - You think is useless, yeah, but it only for fun

You can UPGRADE or Finalize this programm
